# 躺平 tangping

### Context
Fundamental to happiness is enjoying the journey, not achieving the outcome. Put differently, people fill more fulfilled when they experience meaningful growth. 

Growth can be interpretated as: 
growth = action + reflection 

Productivity apps such as Todoist and TickTick are focused around completing tasks. While they empower their users to complete more actions, these productivity apps do little to help in simulation reflection - the second key component for growth. 

The problem statement: there is no app that encourages deliberate practice, a form of meaningful growth.

### What is 躺平
躺平 is designed around three fundamental principles: 
- Induce reflection during and post task/activity/action 
- #rightproblem and #gapanalysis 
- Promote filfullment through meaningful growth (or deliberate pratice)
